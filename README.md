work with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a functional web application that interacts with an external API to provide real-time weather information
Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to approach this project:

1.Project Overview:

The Weather App will have a simple user interface where users can input the name of a city or a location.
Upon submitting the location, the app will fetch weather data from a weather API using JavaScript.
The app will then display the weather information on the screen.

2.Set up the HTML:
Start by creating a basic HTML structure for the app need an input field to enter the location and a button to trigger the weather retrieval.
Add a section to display the weather information once it's fetched from the API.

3.Style the app using CSS:
Create a simple CSS file to style the app. i can make it visually appealing with  preferred design choices

4.Fetch Weather Data using JavaScript:
Create a JavaScript file to handle the weather data retrieval and display it on the screen.


Type the name of a city in the input field and click "Get Weather" to see the weather information.
